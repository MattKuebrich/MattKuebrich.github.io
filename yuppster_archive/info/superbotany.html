The original version of my remix was included with the mp3 supplement to Marumari's remix album. When I made the song, 
Marumari urged me to consider adding some "backwards guitar" to it. I tried my best, and this is the result. I decide 
to submit the original version for the album, but since this one has grown on me and I can consider it the superior song.
