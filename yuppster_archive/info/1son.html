<h3>#1 Son</h3>

This was my 2nd submission for the Child Abuse Project, put on by the now Benn Jordan's (The Flashbulb) now defunct Metatone label. 
<br><br>
Here was the brief:
<br><br>"Background story: A 19 year old boy from Chicago named Matt Gronski was jamming out on a Casio keyboard in the middle of the night, surprisingly, his Mother comes downstairs after being woken up by the ruckass and goes on a psychopathic rampage involving unimaginable screaming and audible beating. Here and only here, you can download this classic masterpiece of domestic violence, remix it, and have it voted on!"
