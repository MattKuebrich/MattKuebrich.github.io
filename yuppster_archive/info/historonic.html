<h3>Historonic Electronic</h3>
self-released / 1999
</div>
<br><br>
For a self-initiated music project over the summer of 1999, I aimed to fill a whole audio CD with music. At 24 tracks and 62-minutes, "Historonic Electronic" pretty much succeeded.<br><br>As an early musical attempt, this album is anything but perfect. It contains lots of stupid samples, the drum programming is just awful, and most of it lacks the strong element of melody that my later Yuppster material has. It has a more experimental element, well, because I was experimenting with different sounds for the first time.<br><br>I do quite like some part of the album, such as the fly sound-effects that accent "Hakuyu", the creepy synth sounds in "Police", and the part in "No More Rhymes Now.." where the drums actually line up with the music.
