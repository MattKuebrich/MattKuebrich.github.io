<h3>Errata</h3>

After buying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031XDW/qid=1138417708/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-7781755-2391804?s=classical&v=glance&n=5174">Frog Peak Collaborations Project</a>, I decided to make my own experimental "1-minute piece based on a recording of Chris Mann's 1-minute text on the nature of collaboration". I named this "errata" because the Frog Peak CD had it's own "errata" insert.
<p>
I was turned on to the album because it included electronic music pioneer, Herbert Brun, whom my wife had as a teacher at the University of Illinois. I interviewed Herbert for a paper I wrote in high school on electronic music.
